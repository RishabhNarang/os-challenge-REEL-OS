Lookup Table:

For this experiment I made a dictionary with a lookup function. This allows the program to fetch the hashes 
if they were already calculated, if the hash doesnt exist then it calculate it and stores it in the dictionary.
The more hashes the program has to calculate, the more efficient this experiment is.
